### _Singapore Polytechnic - ST2321 Infographics AY18/19 CA3_

An infographic created as part of a project during my 3rd year in Singapore Polytechnic, which showcases the results based on a self-conducted airplane passenger satisfaction survey. I based it off with an isometric style and had a lot of fun designing the entire workpiece while playing around with Adobe Illustrator

This application was written for SP ST2321 Infographics CA3 Project.
